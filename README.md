Final exam - allows a user to enter grades for various assignments. Calculates an average based on entries and max scores.

In the future, I'd like to be able to allow a user (such as a teacher) to add multiple classes.
They'll also be able to create their own assignments, and give them a max score. 
Very few things are hardcoded, only in the variables names. This can easily be edited for future reusability. 
Makes heavy use of arrays! Parallel arrays are amazing!
